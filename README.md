Duuuude, I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Ugly Stepsister and my brain is like...what just happened, seriously? 😂 Like, I knew I had to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   because everyone kept talking about it, and now I totally get why everyone's buzzing.

I mean, the whole thing was such a trip, right? The way they flipped the script on the fairytale thing—it caught me off guard in a good way though. Sometimes, the way they juxtaposed everything just made me laugh out loud. It's like they sat down and said “screw it, let's just mess with people’s expectations,” haha!

> And okay, can we talk about the soundtrack for a sec? It was… surprisingly awesome?? I didn’t expect to get hit with those feels from a comedy. I guess that’s when you know it’s a good vibe. Like, each scene had a little beat that hit just right, you feel me?

The main character, oh my god, what a trainwreck in the best way. I rooted for her and cringed at her all at once. But maybe that’s just me projecting a little, you know? 😂 Sometimes I was like, “girl, why you making it so hard for yourself?” Though, she did remind me of my cousin who’s always in some drama. Wild.

And then the ending...uhhh, it was kinda all over the place? Not sure if they planned it like that or were winging it, but it worked, you know? I low-key love when things are unpredictable, keeps it exciting. Definitely didn’t see that twist coming, like WTF even?! 🙃

int x = (int)Math.Round(randomVariable);

Anyway, it was worth 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   tonight, despite my brain being mush now. I might need a nap to process all that hilarious chaos. As much of a mess as it was, sometimes life’s just that messy too, ya know? Let’s chat soon and catch up more!
